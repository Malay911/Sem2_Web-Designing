        Media Queries

    <p class="info">
        Media queries are a way to target browser by certain characteristics, features, and user
        preferences, then apply styles or run other code based on those things. <br>
        Perhaps the most common media queries in the world are those that target particular viewport
        ranges and apply custom styles, which is the whole idea of responsive design.
