        Introduction to CSS3 <br>
        CSS3 is the latest standard for CSS. <br>
        CSS3 is completely backwards-compatible with earlier versions of CSS. <br>
        CSS3 has been split into "modules". It contains the "old CSS specification" (which has been
        split into smaller pieces). In addition, new modules are added. <br>
        CSS3 Transitions are a presentational effect which allow property changes in CSS values, such
        as those that may be defined to occur on :hover or :focus, to occur smoothly over a specified
        duration - rather than happening instantaneously as is the normal behavior. <br>
        Transition effects can be applied to a wide variety of CSS properties, including background-
        color, width, height, opacity, and many more.
