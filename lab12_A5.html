        Nissan GT-R
    </p>
    <p class="info">
        The Nissan GT-R (Gran Turismo-Racing; model code: R35; Japanese: 日産・GT-R; Nissan GT-R) is a car built by Japanese marque Nissan since 2007. <br>
        It has a 2+2 seating layout and is considered both a sports car and a grand tourer. The engine is front-mid mounted and drives all four wheels. <br>
        It succeeds the Nissan Skyline GT-R, a faster variant of the Nissan Skyline. <br>
        Although this model was the sixth-generation to bear the GT-R name, it is no longer part of the Skyline line-up. <br>
        The car is built on the PM platform, derived from the FM platform used in the Skyline and Nissan Z models. <br>
        Production is conducted in a shared production line at Nissan's Tochigi plant in Japan.
